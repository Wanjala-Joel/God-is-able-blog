            <h2>About God Is Able agencies</h2>
            <p>
              God Is Able Agency is an evangelist group that is founded and
              rooted on the word of God. The group started from Kenyatta
              University officially on 9/2/2019 and has spread to many other
              campuses and colleges. It was started as the group of three people
              but has grown to hundreds of members. G.I.A is neither church nor
              group based on specific religious doctrine but a bible based body.
              It consists of members from all denominations including catholic
              and Seventh Day Adventist Churches. The group does not change
              people’s denominations or change their religion but empower people
              to know bible truth (Spiritual truth) through reading, teaching
              and practicing the word. G.I.A is a family of disciples of Christ.
              We focus on building up disciples rather than increasing the
              number.
            </p>
            <p>
              The members are committed to reading the word daily, fasting at
              least three days a month, visiting orphans at least twice a year.
              Members of the group are able to minister in relation to area of
              their call. What is very evident in the group is that all members
              are filled with the holy spirit including the Catholics and SDA
              evidenced through speaking in other tongues. The group contain
              various tribes in Kenya and two members from Tanzania.

          <h2>Pillars of G.I.A</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Love</h4>
              <p>
                God Is Able Agency upholds love as one of the most important
                virtue of all. We love God with all our hearts, all our souls
                and with all our minds, we love our neighbors as we love
                ourselves (Mark12:28-34). We are inspired by the words of John,
                "Dear friends let us love one another, for love comes from God.
                Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows
                God(1john4:7)." Paul says love is patient, love is kind. It does
                not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud…… (1Cor13:4-8). God
                Is Able Agency want to be and known as a family of love.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Righteousness</h4>
              <p>
                God command us to live holy and righteous life shunning away
                from all evil by all means. Abraham, Job, Joseph and Mary
                attained this state of righteousness meaning that even us in
                this age we can still attain it. Righteousness is the state
                attained by living according to God’s word and following his
                voice and will in Christ Jesus in every aspect of our life. This
                can only be achieved by the grace of God on our life (Spirit of
                God). The one who has called us is holy so want us to be
                holy(1Pet1:15-16).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Sacrifice and commitment</h4>
              <p>
                The success of this family depends on the commitment and
                sacrifice of members towards the G.I.A vision, mission and
                objectives. Members sacrifices fare to the mission ground and
                additional costs for orphans and street children home visit.
                Every disciple takes the initiative to spread the gospel of God
                to less reached places, because if we don’t then none can do it.
                The members sacrifice time in prayer, fasting and reading the
                word of God because they want to walk in the power of Christ
                every place they go and to bring revival. We study the word with
                great eagerness and examine scriptures daily to know its truth,
                exercise it and operate in it without limit and exception.
                (Acts17:11).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Word of God without exception</h4>
              <p>
                Every practice of the group is bible based. Nothing is done
                outside the word of God. The holy bible is the root and
                foundation of every activity done in the group. Jesus Christ is
                the cornerstone that we preach and is our role model. We
                practice everything he was teaching and doing while on earth.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Service and submission</h4>
              <p>
                Every member in the group is a servant and serve the lord Jesus
                at their own operational levels of grace upon them. We believe
                that all are called to serve in the vineyard of God and not just
                specific people. We are also committed to submission to the will
                of God and to serve in every area of call. Submission is all
                about service. The bible says that whoever wants to be greater
                must serve others to the will of God. The bible also says
                whoever wants to be great must serve just like the son of man
                come not to be served but to serve (Math20:26-28).
