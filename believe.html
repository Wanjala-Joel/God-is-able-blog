            <div class="list-group-1">
              <li>
                We believe in one God who reveals himself in three dimension,
                Father, Son and Holy Spirit as the creator of heaven and earth
                (Mat28:19).
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in the lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of
                God, who was conceived of the holy spirit, born of the virgin
                Mary, crucified, died buried, resurrected and ascended to heaven
                and now is sited at the right hand of his father and God (Acts
                2:23-24,32).
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in the power of God through his word, manifestation
                (1cor4:20, 1The1:5, 1Cor2:4-5) We believe in double healing,
                miracles, signs and wonders through faith in the name of Jesus
                Christ (Mark16:17-20).
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in double baptism, that is that of water (John1:26,
                Acts11:16, Acts19:3-6) and the Holy Spirit evidenced through
                speaking in tongues as the spirit give utterance (Act2:4,
                1Cor12:10, Act10:45-46).
              </li>
            </div>
            <div class="list-group-2">
              <li>
                We believe fully in the teaching of Jesus Christ and all the
                demonstration of the power of God through him, his and our
                Father. We believe in the supernatural operation and
                intervention of God. We also believe nothing is impossible in
                his glorious name.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in the resurrection of the dead both the righteous
                and unrighteous. The eternal blessing to the redeemed and the
                eternal torment of those who rejected, blasphemed Christ Jesus
                and Holy Spirit and walked in flesh conforming to the deeds and
                standards of this word.
              </li>
              <li>We believe in the second coming of Jesus Christ.</li>
              <li>
                We believe that all that repents of their sin and confess the
                son of God, Jesus Christ with their mouth and believe in their
                hearts that he come in flesh, died and was risen by the power of
                God are born again and therefore become children of God.
              </li>
            </div>
            <div class="list-group-3">
              <li>
                We believe in sanctification through the word of God, blood of
                Jesus and the holy Spirit and in personal righteousness, purity
                of heart and life.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe that Jesus was for all who believe in him and not
                religious hence we donâ€™t limit a specific person joining us on
                grounds of their denomination.
              </li>
              <li>
                We also believe in submitting to authority, and the group is not
                above the law of the state in anyway and those who went before
                us in relation to the word of God.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe that Jesus Christ commissioned each of us to spread
                his word with the mandate to empty hell and fill heaven and all
                denominations of Christ Jesus are called to this call hence
                multi-denominational.
